BODY_TECTURE:
*Following my interest on how computational design and parametrization affect other disciplines outside of architecture, 
my application would be a configurator that allow to test jewelries and clothes in real time. 
Necklace, dress and a bracelet that change depending on sliders  which you can manipulate in real time, tested on a body. 
These three garments are automated (get their mass and multiply it by the price of silver or tissue) in a way to get the price of them and display the total price on the web each time their volume change. 
Moreover, additional options such as hiding the body or the dress attractor points are also there.

*The plugins I used  are pufferfish and weaverbird.
